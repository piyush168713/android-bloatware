# Android Bloatware
Android phones come with lots of unwanted bloatware apps. An easy uninstall option however remains unavailable.

Fortunately its possible to remove/deactivate the apps without root using ADB commands.
The shell script `android-cleanup.sh` takes care of removing of presumably safe to remove apps.

If however something goes wrong, then the rollback script `android-rollback.sh` helps out.
